A and C are essential to have Full Expression. Update 2-26-19 - Passive observation ala Krishnamurti. Just chill. Dont do anything. Just observe whatever is present.

Any ways I say gitty up because its little traveled territory for men to have a legit opinion on feminist issues, but if you see something say something, right?

In that sense, feminist sexuality exists wherever women are controlling or have an equal role in the sexual agenda.
