MtB also could be taken as a use of reason and also a disciplining of the senses to focus on beauty (i.e. all the pretty flowers, all the pretty birds). (Update 3-16-21 -This is one of the first 4 points created because they were on the top of my mind when I first started this project.

But the sad reality is that people need to have some sort of cred to show that realness and all these discussions can be taxing on the brain to us uberly (Update 2-19-19 Word doesn’t think this is a word) politically sensitive individuals to the point that our brain oozes out our ears.

Update 2-19-19 Feminism is important to me because I see half the population of the world suffering from a patriarchical prejudice that is stunting the growth of civilization. If that’s not enough to be a feminist, I don’t know what is. Prejudice is inherently dumb. Patriarchy is a biased archaic system. Any ways I say gitty up because its little traveled territory for men to have a legit opinion on feminist issues, but if you see something say something, right? Taking the concept of full expression as an example of maximized beauty, we see its extreme importance in all of our lives. Older but mildly edited writing It’s about comfort to express fully - inequality runs deep - share your beautiful life grrrl! Be all you and that’s all you need to be satisfied… But for real tho sex positive feminism…. can’t say enough about it. You see in sexuality there’s a power of agenda (i.e. who sets the agenda is the powerful one). In that sense, feminist sexuality exists wherever women are controlling or have an equal role in the sexual agenda. I would also argue that feminist sexuality exists wherever women are satisfied with the sexual agenda or satisfied with their decision to engage in a sexual act even if they are totally lacking any control of the agenda. Update 2-19-19 – Is there a backlash against sex positivity in 2019? Could it be just a general distaste in men? Or could it be the influence of fascism in the world? Are we subtly acting more fascist towards how we approach sex?\n",

In the Zen Buddhist tradition, satori refers to the experience of kenshō, \"seeing into one's true nature\".” As seen by the god known as Wikipedia, Barthes may not be talking out of his ass but he is at least stretching this word out past its meaning to make some other meaning in writing that also just lacks feeling and authenticity.\n",

First, there’s the ideals behind the music of Frank Sinatra which highlight a satisfaction with monogamous romantic love in all its ageless glory. I then give two anecdotes. The first is about my first real monogamous love Erin who I went to prom with, lost my virginity to, and continued to date my freshman year into my sophomore year. There was an agelessness to our senior prom that inspires me to love that moment in time to this day. The prom photos help. Also that time connects to the story my grandma told me about her friends dancing in their basement to these songs from the who knows when, but obviously from the 20’s to mid-40s would be my guess. All of this points to the ideals of love which state: a) Love involves the romantic events that truly fulfill us. b) The emotion of romantic love provides true satisfaction. c) Loving relationships are the poetry of human interactions. Affection as a deeper human beauty. \n",

It’s that no matter how shitty life is, there are things we can do to make up for the trauma we endure. It’s that we can feel our stress and feel our bodies trying to battle that stress. The basic idea is that at any given time we feel like we are in that like new feeling to a certain percentage. For example, if you are feeling totally refreshed and at your best you feel 100% reset.\n",

An idea brought up by Nietzsche, which states that pity is more on the end of useless and honor is more on the end of useful because honor comes from respect for someone whereas pity comes from viewing negativity associated with a person. So for me this is a bit of a tough concept to always understand because I imagine examples of the homeless (i.e. if you give someone money is that out of pity always??? I don’t think so because you just see that they have a lot of qualities you respect in them and give them some cash out of hope for that better side winning out, right?)\n",

Nah… you really aren’t you just have cultivated a certain set of habits that you could change. Views that can change. Is there an inherent meaning to anything? Not really even sure we need to explore this concept, but if we look at nihilism as the total rejection of meaning in anything we can see that this sort of concept is kind of dumb. Like words have meaning bro. A priori type logic is real bro. What can we gain from thinking of words as signals to things that exist in some approximate form? Authenticity…warm glowy feelings from grasping onto something solid? So yeah that part 1. Part 2 gists – like maybe it’s the concept that we can get the gist of all things…maybe it’s the opposite of nihilism that there is a reason for why everything happens that is perfectly explainable because the reasons are based on things with meaning.

First, there’s the ideals behind the music of Frank Sinatra which highlight a satisfaction with monogamous romantic love in all its ageless glory. I then give two anecdotes. The first is about my first real monogamous love Erin who I went to prom with, lost my virginity to, and continued to date my freshman year into my sophomore year. There was an agelessness to our senior prom that inspires me to love that moment in time to this day. The prom photos help. Also that time connects to the story my grandma told me about her friends dancing in their basement to these songs from the who knows when, but obviously from the 20’s to mid-40s would be my guess. All of this points to the ideals of love which state: a) Love involves the romantic events that truly fulfill us. b) The emotion of romantic love provides true satisfaction. c) Loving relationships are the poetry of human interactions. Affection as a deeper human beauty. \n",

      "Original Number: 30, Content: 30) feminism - gitty up! Update 2-19-19 Feminism is important to me because I see half the population of the world suffering from a patriarchical prejudice that is stunting the growth of civilization. If that’s not enough to be a feminist, I don’t know what is. Prejudice is inherently dumb. Patriarchy is a biased archaic system. Any ways I say gitty up because its little traveled territory for men to have a legit opinion on feminist issues, but if you see something say something, right? Taking the concept of full expression as an example of maximized beauty, we see its extreme importance in all of our lives. Older but mildly edited writing It’s about comfort to express fully - inequality runs deep - share your beautiful life grrrl! Be all you and that’s all you need to be satisfied… But for real tho sex positive feminism…. can’t say enough about it. You see in sexuality there’s a power of agenda (i.e. who sets the agenda is the powerful one). In that sense, feminist sexuality exists wherever women are controlling or have an equal role in the sexual agenda. I would also argue that feminist sexuality exists wherever women are satisfied with the sexual agenda or satisfied with their decision to engage in a sexual act even if they are totally lacking any control of the agenda. Update 2-19-19 – Is there a backlash against sex positivity in 2019? Could it be just a general distaste in men? Or could it be the influence of fascism in the world? Are we subtly acting more fascist towards how we approach sex?\n",

MtB also could be taken as a use of reason and also a disciplining of the senses to focus on beauty (i.e. all the pretty flowers, all the pretty birds). (Update 3-16-21 -This is one of the first 4 points created because they were on the top of my mind when I first started this project.

First, there’s the ideals behind the music of Frank Sinatra which highlight a satisfaction with monogamous romantic love in all its ageless glory. I then give two anecdotes. The first is about my first real monogamous love Erin who I went to prom with, lost my virginity to, and continued to date my freshman year into my sophomore year. There was an agelessness to our senior prom that inspires me to love that moment in time to this day. The prom photos help. Also that time connects to the story my grandma told me about her friends dancing in their basement to these songs from the who knows when, but obviously from the 20’s to mid-40s would be my guess. All of this points to the ideals of love which state: a) Love involves the romantic events that truly fulfill us. b) The emotion of romantic love provides true satisfaction. c) Loving relationships are the poetry of human interactions. Affection as a deeper human beauty. \n",

      "Document ID: 29, Content: 30) feminism - gitty up! Update 2-19-19 Feminism is important to me because I see half the population of the world suffering from a patriarchical prejudice that is stunting the growth of civilization. If that’s not enough to be a feminist, I don’t know what is. Prejudice is inherently dumb. Patriarchy is a biased archaic system. Any ways I say gitty up because its little traveled territory for men to have a legit opinion on feminist issues, but if you see something say something, right? Taking the concept of full expression as an example of maximized beauty, we see its extreme importance in all of our lives. Older but mildly edited writing It’s about comfort to express fully - inequality runs deep - share your beautiful life grrrl! Be all you and that’s all you need to be satisfied… But for real tho sex positive feminism…. can’t say enough about it. You see in sexuality there’s a power of agenda (i.e. who sets the agenda is the powerful one). In that sense, feminist sexuality exists wherever women are controlling or have an equal role in the sexual agenda. I would also argue that feminist sexuality exists wherever women are satisfied with the sexual agenda or satisfied with their decision to engage in a sexual act even if they are totally lacking any control of the agenda. Update 2-19-19 – Is there a backlash against sex positivity in 2019? Could it be just a general distaste in men? Or could it be the influence of fascism in the world? Are we subtly acting more fascist towards how we approach sex?\n",

      "Document ID: 0, Content: 1) Maximize the Beauty - fully channel the beauty with in. Maybe ask what makes this moment beautiful? See if beauty can be increased in every situation. MtB also could be taken as a use of reason and also a disciplining of the senses to focus on beauty (i.e. all the pretty flowers, all the pretty birds). (Update 3-16-21 -This is one of the first 4 points created because they were on the top of my mind when I first started this project. Maximize the Beauty and Full Expression still are some of the concepts I am most influenced by, create an ethos around, consider to be primary to my concept of virtue, and aim to implement as much as possible.) \n",
      "Document ID: 72, Content: 73) The Joy of Sacrifice - Sacrificing things is really just adding other things, but doesn’t it feel good to stop doing something so you can increase the love you have for someone in such a solid way. Real sacrifice leading to an increase in real love to the degree that it seems to have scientific causality (i.e. science would be like, “yo Adam you gonna love the shit out of dis person if you sacrifice all these things that occupy yo time when you could be putting in that time to increase love, beauty, harmony, positivity, real feelings that make life worthwhile, and end the cycle of bullshit that seems to flow into your life, fo real, this is science talking to you, looking you dead in the eye, straight up, not lying, and you know that, cause I’m fucking science bitch and a female so I can use the term bitch.”\n",

      "Document ID: 48, Content: 49) Satisfied – Frank Sinatra like Erin Prom Virginity off to College Ideals of Love<-- Romance & ageless Like Gramma Basement Dance Parties This Point is like 19 points – but it all surrounds Frank Sinatra Love and Satisfaction. First, there’s the ideals behind the music of Frank Sinatra which highlight a satisfaction with monogamous romantic love in all its ageless glory. I then give two anecdotes. The first is about my first real monogamous love Erin who I went to prom with, lost my virginity to, and continued to date my freshman year into my sophomore year. There was an agelessness to our senior prom that inspires me to love that moment in time to this day. The prom photos help. Also that time connects to the story my grandma told me about her friends dancing in their basement to these songs from the who knows when, but obviously from the 20’s to mid-40s would be my guess. All of this points to the ideals of love which state: a) Love involves the romantic events that truly fulfill us. b) The emotion of romantic love provides true satisfaction. c) Loving relationships are the poetry of human interactions. Affection as a deeper human beauty. \n",

Nor did she have the intellectual depth or descriptive beauty, but her melodies are haunting as is her vibe in general. Never releasing music on her own that was so amazing. There’s a realness to that. It’s like “These songs are mine and help me. I am content with that. Sorry world. No hard feelings. Much Love, Sibylle Baier.”\n",

Generalities can be beautiful (I’m thinking of my black Brazilian friend talking about his pride over the accomplishments of American Blacks at like 8 am 24 floors up in Sao Paulo after a night dancing to 50’s music and just his strange use of English while explaining his generally beautiful idea). But the sad reality is that people need to have some sort of cred to show that realness and all these discussions can be taxing on the brain to us uberly (Update 2-19-19 Word doesn’t think this is a word) politically sensitive individuals to the point that our brain oozes out our ears. Ahhh but there is a higher self with in waiting to erupt spewing for lava-like beauty in the form of learning at an accelerated yet stress free pace.\n",
      "Document ID: 29, Content: 30) feminism - gitty up! Update 2-19-19 Feminism is important to me because I see half the population of the world suffering from a patriarchical prejudice that is stunting the growth of civilization. If that’s not enough to be a feminist, I don’t know what is. Prejudice is inherently dumb. Patriarchy is a biased archaic system. Any ways I say gitty up because its little traveled territory for men to have a legit opinion on feminist issues, but if you see something say something, right? Taking the concept of full expression as an example of maximized beauty, we see its extreme importance in all of our lives. Older but mildly edited writing It’s about comfort to express fully - inequality runs deep - share your beautiful life grrrl! Be all you and that’s all you need to be satisfied… But for real tho sex positive feminism…. can’t say enough about it. You see in sexuality there’s a power of agenda (i.e. who sets the agenda is the powerful one). In that sense, feminist sexuality exists wherever women are controlling or have an equal role in the sexual agenda. I would also argue that feminist sexuality exists wherever women are satisfied with the sexual agenda or satisfied with their decision to engage in a sexual act even if they are totally lacking any control of the agenda. Update 2-19-19 – Is there a backlash against sex positivity in 2019? Could it be just a general distaste in men? Or could it be the influence of fascism in the world? Are we subtly acting more fascist towards how we approach sex?\n",

There are people that just do that in our hearts every time we see them. Let the weight of that beauty crush you…again and again.\n",
