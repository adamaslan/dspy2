Update 2-19-19 Feminism is important to me because I see half the population of the world suffering from a patriarchical prejudice that is stunting the growth of civilization. If that’s not enough to be a feminist, I don’t know what is. Prejudice is inherently dumb. Patriarchy is a biased archaic system. Any ways I say gitty up because its little traveled territory for men to have a legit opinion on feminist issues, but if you see something say something, right? Taking the concept of full expression as an example of maximized beauty, we see its extreme importance in all of our lives. Older but mildly edited writing It’s about comfort to express fully - inequality runs deep - share your beautiful life grrrl! Be all you and that’s all you need to be satisfied… But for real tho sex positive feminism…. can’t say enough about it. You see in sexuality there’s a power of agenda (i.e. who sets the agenda is the powerful one). In that sense, feminist sexuality exists wherever women are controlling or have an equal role in the sexual agenda. I would also argue that feminist sexuality exists wherever women are satisfied with the sexual agenda or satisfied with their decision to engage in a sexual act even if they are totally lacking any control of the agenda. Update 2-19-19 – Is there a backlash against sex positivity in 2019? Could it be just a general distaste in men? Or could it be the influence of fascism in the world? Are we subtly acting more fascist towards how we approach sex?",

The first is about my first real monogamous love Erin who I went to prom with, lost my virginity to, and continued to date my freshman year into my sophomore year. There was an agelessness to our senior prom that inspires me to love that moment in time to this day. The prom photos help. Also that time connects to the story my grandma told me about her friends dancing in their basement to these songs from the who knows when, but obviously from the 20’s to mid-40s would be my guess. All of this points to the ideals of love which state: a) Love involves the romantic events that truly fulfill us. b) The emotion of romantic love provides true satisfaction. c) Loving relationships are the poetry of human interactions. Affection as a deeper human beauty. ",

My point is this: “Who Cares?” We can rage against the falsity of our age or we can just accept it and not think about it, but also, with so few caring about this issue one has to wonder should the few of us that do care even bother wasting our time.

Update -2-20-19 – we talking bout gists here…so the gist of nihilism to me is that stuff has less inherent meaning than we think. I am this. Nah… you really aren’t you just have cultivated a certain set of habits that you could change. Views that can change. Is there an inherent meaning to anything? Not really even sure we need to explore this concept, but if we look at nihilism as the total rejection of meaning in anything we can see that this sort of concept is kind of dumb. Like words have meaning bro. A priori type logic is real bro. What can we gain from thinking of words as signals to things that exist in some approximate form? Authenticity…warm glowy feelings from grasping onto something solid? So yeah that part 1. Part 2 gists – like maybe it’s the concept that we can get the gist of all things…maybe it’s the opposite of nihilism that there is a reason for why everything happens that is perfectly explainable because the reasons are based on things with meaning. Maybe it’s a relative meaning but fuck dis absolute shit in that its maybe just not really all that discoverable or useful.",
