# Codebase overview (concise descriptions, expanded +20 tokens each)

This file lists every file in the repo with a short, focused description. Notebook entries may include a few notable cells; ask to expand any notebook into strict 10-token-per-cell summaries.


## Files (deduplicated)

`101.ipynb` — LLM experiments; ColBERT init; search demo; prediction examples; small tests. Contains model calls, example prompts, embedding checks, and quick benchmarking cells.

`151-semantic-output.png` — visualization: semantic retrieval output snapshot. Helpful for demos and README illustrations showing retrieval results and score heatmap.

`151_ideas_hash_table.json` — serialized hash table mapping ids → ideas for fast lookup. Used by experiments to return full idea objects from search hits quickly.

`151_ideas_hash_table2.json` — alternate/hash-table variant, backup or experiment. Contains slightly different keys/metadata for A/B test of retrieval performance.

`151_ideas_updated.csv` — ideas CSV: id, title, text, metadata columns. Canonical dataset for embedding, indexing, and manual inspection; used in notebooks.

`151_ideas_updated2.csv` — revised ideas CSV; edited rows or staging copy. Useful to stage edits before merging back into production CSV.

`151vector.faiss` — FAISS index binary holding embedded vectors. Primary semantic index built from `151_ideas_updated.csv` for fast nearest-neighbor searches.

`151vector.ipynb` — build/load FAISS; create embeddings; search demo cells. Shows embedding pipeline, indexing steps, and example similarity queries with results.

`151vector2.ipynb` — alternate FAISS notebook; embedding experiments; queries. Variant experiments with different embedding models, parameter tuning, and evaluation cells.

`articles.csv` — article dataset CSV used for embeddings/training. Contains raw article text, titles, and source metadata for retrieval experiments.

`dspy1.ipynb` — data prep and initial RAG experiments; assorted demo cells. Includes cleaning, tokenization checks, and toy retrieval pipelines for prototyping.

`dspy-rag1.ipynb` — RAG prototype: keyword+semantic retrieval pipeline cells. Demonstrates combining inverted index hits with FAISS for context assembly.

`dspy-rag2.ipynb` — SemanticRetriever class; CSV processing; retriever tests. Contains class definition, unit-like test cells, and small performance notes.

`dspydocs1.ipynb` — dev server notes, request handling, debug/log cells. Contains server startup examples, request/response traces, and sample cURL tests.

`dspydocs2.ipynb` — follow-up docs and server tweaks; logging examples. Adds middleware notes, improved error handling, and logging-format examples.

`hashtable-invertedindex.ipynb` — inverted index construction; hash-table retrieval demo. Steps to build token→doc index, query examples, and scoring heuristics.

`ideas.pickle` — pickled Python object storing ideas list/dict. Quick binary snapshot used by notebooks for faster loads during experiments.

`ideas1.faiss` — smaller FAISS index used for tests or alternate data. Useful for CI-like quick experiments where full index is unnecessary.

`judge.ipynb` — evaluation notebook: judge experiments and tracebacks. Contains scoring functions, comparisons, and error analysis cells.

`judge2.ipynb` — variant evaluations and debugging cells. Iterative runs of evaluation scripts with changed metrics and brief plots.

`judge3.ipynb` — more evaluation runs and metadata outputs. Collects run metadata, summaries, and a few visualization cells for results.

`judge4.ipynb` — additional judge experiments and summaries. Final tweaks, aggregated metrics, and export-ready result tables.

`keyword-rag1.ipynb` — manual inverted index and hash-table retrieval examples. Demonstrates keyword search, heuristics, and fallback to semantic retrieval.

`new-chatbot1.ipynb` — chatbot prototype: prompts, example dialogs, tests. Contains conversation flows, prompt templates, and evaluation dialogues.

`nu-rag1.ipynb` — alternate RAG flow; embedding and retrieval tests. Experimenting with different prompt injection strategies and retrieval ordering.

`pickler1.ipynb` — pickle read/write demos and utility cells. Shows safe save/load patterns, binary size checks, and basic serialization utilities.

`pickler2.ipynb` — batch pickling examples and load/save utilities. Batch export/import patterns, performance timings, and version notes.

`.gitignore` — rules for files to ignore in git. Excludes data, virtualenvs, large binaries, and local editor configs.

`pip` — local pip helper folder or script (environment tooling). Might contain small helper scripts to manage local packages or venv setup.

`project_state.pkl` — saved project state snapshot (pickle binary). Stores last-run metadata, checkpoints, and pointers to indexes.

`tablisi/` — subdirectory containing additional project files. Contains project-specific utilities or data (inspect folder for details).

`allfiles.md` — this overview file: concise per-file descriptions. Maintained for developer orientation; updated automatically on request.

## Ranked by AI output & functionality

1. `151vector.ipynb` — High AI output: builds embeddings and FAISS; central to semantic retrieval experiments and indexing workflow.
2. `dspy-rag2.ipynb` — High functionality: `SemanticRetriever` class, integrated tests, core retriever logic for RAG experiments.
3. `dspy-rag1.ipynb` — High relevance: RAG prototype combining keyword+semantic retrieval; used as integration example.
4. `151_ideas_updated.csv` — Data core: canonical ideas dataset powering embedding/index creation and evaluation.
5. `151vector.faiss` — Runtime store: FAISS index used for fast nearest-neighbor searches; essential to retrieval experiments.
6. `151_ideas_hash_table.json` — Support: hash table to map ids to idea objects; speeds up lookup for search hits.
7. `new-chatbot1.ipynb` — Application: chatbot prototype demonstrating prompt flows and retrieval-integration examples for demos.
8. `judge.ipynb` — Evaluation: notebooks used to score, compare outputs, and analyze retrieval/judge metrics.
9. `articles.csv` — Auxiliary data: article inputs used for embedding experiments and retrieval tests.
10. `hashtable-invertedindex.ipynb` — Utility: inverted index construction and keyword retrieval heuristics.

Notes on ranking: I ranked by a mix of (a) AI-related content (embedding/indexing code, retriever classes), (b) practical functionality (indexes, datasets), and (c) demo/app notebooks. If you'd like a different ranking metric (most edited, largest file, or test coverage), tell me and I'll re-rank.

Notes:
- Descriptions expanded by ~20 tokens each where possible. If you'd like exact token counts per entry or strict per-cell 10-token summaries for certain notebooks, tell me which notebooks to expand next.

## Useful prompts — reuse to recreate this MD for other repos

Below are compact prompt templates you can feed to an LLM to generate the same `allfiles.md` structure for any repository. Replace placeholders (REPO, FILE_LIST, etc.) as needed.

1) Repo inventory + concise descriptions (≈20 tokens per file)

```
You are a repository assistant. Given FILE_LIST, produce a markdown file titled "Codebase overview". For each file produce one line: `filename` — short description (≈20 tokens). Group notebooks under "Notebooks". End with a short "Notes" line.
```

2) Deduplicate and consolidate entries

```
Given a markdown file with repeated file entries, remove duplicates, keep a single canonical entry per file, and add a short summary line listing how duplicates were consolidated.
```

3) Add ranked section by AI output & functionality

```
Rank the repository files by AI output and practical functionality. Produce a top-N list (default N=10) with one-line justification for each ranking. Prefer files involved in embeddings, indexes, retrievers, and demos.
```

4) Produce strict 10-token per-cell notebook summaries

```
For the notebook FILE.ipynb, read its cell list and output one 10-token summary per cell in order. Only 10 tokens per cell; do not add extra commentary.
```

5) Full generator prompt (end-to-end)

```
You are a documentation generator. Input: REPO_ROOT path. Do: (1) list all files, (2) deduplicate entries, (3) produce ≈20-token descriptions per file, (4) add a ranked top-10 by AI output/functionality, (5) append useful prompts section. Output: a single markdown document named allfiles.md.
```

6) Quick CLI-style instruction for automation

```
Script: git ls-files | jq -R -s -c 'split("\n")[:-1]' -> pass array to LLM with prompt template #5 to generate allfiles.md.
```

If you want, I can add a small Python script that runs locally to produce this `allfiles.md` automatically using one of the prompts above and the file list; tell me whether to generate it.
